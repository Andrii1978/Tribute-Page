        <h2>Short biography of Isaac Newton</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day, <strong>25 December 1642</strong> at Woolsthorpe Manor in
                Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire</li>
            <li><strong>in 1655</strong>, 12-year-old Newton was sent to study at a nearby school in Grantham, where he
                lived in the home of the pharmacist Clark</li>
            <li><strong>in 1661</strong>, Newton successfully graduated from high school and went to continue his
                education at the University of Cambridge</li>
            <li><strong>in June 1661</strong>, 18-year-old Newton came to Cambridge. According to the charter, he was
                given an examination in Latin, after which he was informed that he was admitted to Trinity College
                (College of the Holy Trinity) of the University of Cambridge. More than 30 years of Newton's life are
                associated with this educational institution</li>
            <li><strong>in April 1664</strong>, Newton, after passing the exams, was promoted to the higher category of
                undergraduates (scholars), which earned him the right to a scholarship and continue his studies in
                college</li>
            <li><strong>the year 1664</strong> in Newton's life was rich in other events. Newton experienced a creative
                upsurge, began an independent scientific activity and compiled a large-scale list (of 45 points) of
                unsolved problems in nature and human life. He made the first significant mathematical discovery:
                binomial expansion for an arbitrary rational exponent (including negative ones), and through it he came
                to his main mathematical method - the expansion of a function in an infinite series. At the very end of
                the year, Newton became a bachelor</li>
            <li><strong>1665-1667</strong> due to the plague he spent in Woolsthorpe, where he made a significant part
                of his scientific discoveries</li>
            <li><strong>in early 1667</strong>the epidemic subsided, and in April Newton returned to Cambridge. On
                October 1, he was elected a Fellow of Trinity College, and in 1668 he became a Master</li>
            <li><strong>on October 29, 1669</strong>, 26-year-old Newton was elected to the position of "Lucasian
                professor" of mathematics and optics at Trinity College. During this period, Newton was seriously
                carried away by alchemy, conducted a lot of chemical experiments</li>
            <li><strong>in late 1671 - early 1672</strong>, a demonstration of the reflector, which gave a 40-fold
                increase in excellent quality, took place in front of the king, and then in the Royal Society. The
                device has received rave reviews from all over the world. Later, improved reflectors became the main
                instrumen</li>
            <li><strong>in January 1672</strong> Newton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society</li>
            <li><strong>1684-1686</strong> - works on the main book of his life "Mathematical Principles of Natural
                Philosophy". On April 28, 1686, the first volume of Mathematical Principles was presented to the Royal
                Society. All three volumes, after some copyright correction, were published in 1687</li>
            <li><strong>in 1689</strong>, Newton was elected to Parliament from the University of Cambridge and sat
                there for a little over a year. Was a member of parliament again in 1701-1702</li>
            <li><strong>in 1696</strong> Newton took over as curator of the Mint, left Cambridge and moved to London
            </li>
            <li><strong>in November 1703</strong>, Newton was elected president of the Royal Society and ruled the
                Society for the rest of his life - more than twenty years</li>
            <li><strong>in 1705</strong>, Queen Anne elevated Newton to the dignity of knighthood. From now on he is Sir
                Isaac Newton</li>
            <li><strong>in 1707</strong>, a collection of Newton's lectures on algebra, called "Universal Arithmetic",
                was published. The numerical methods presented in it marked the birth of a new promising discipline -
                numerical analysis</li>
            <li><strong>in 1725</strong>, Newton's health began to deteriorate noticeably, and he moved to Kensington
                near London, where he died at night, in a dream, on March 20 (31), 1727</li>
        </ul>
